### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Valentin Massart, a junior web developer with a passion for learning and sharing knowledge. I am also a musician and a scouting enthousiast.

In 2020, I started learning programming online. I also resumed learning Dutch and Russian. Here you can find a sample of the learning paths that I have walked until today.

These are the websites with some kind of track record, but there is also <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/en/members/53kkct2pjw26">Open Classrooms</a>, <a href="https://www.enki.com/">Enki</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.askills.edu.ethical.hacking.university&hl=fr&gl=US">Ethical Hacking University</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/user/cfec59a1b5c8a152ad682a7081f5732f">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://learn.skillcrush.com/classes/skillcrush-free-coding-camp/">Skill Crush</a>, and more... 

<br />

After all those learning experiences, I eventually started writing some interesting code. I take pride in writing code that is easily readable, with meaningful variable names and useful comments (comments that explain why, and not what). My <a href="https://exercism.org/profiles/massartval">Exercism</a> profile shows my most recent progress. I found this platform at a time when I got a bit overwhelmed while building my first real-world project (a music school website that I am currently working on), and it has greatly helped me improve my understanding of javascript (and of programming concepts in general). I am quite proud of my <a href="https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/poker/solutions/massartval">Poker</a> algorithm, for instance.
